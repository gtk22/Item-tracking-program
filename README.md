# Item-tracking-program
This project was made to analyze text records a company has generated throughout the day and list the items in chronological order from open to close. 
I believe I did particularly well with the modularity and clarity when it comes toi the functions.
Things I can improve upon would be like adding a more robust error handling and implementing smart pointers for resource management.
Some challenging aspects would be File I/O and the histogram display.
C++ STL documentation and Debugging tools were great resources while building the code.
Some transferrable skills I learned would be Data Management and UI Design.
I bmade the program maintaionable and adaptable by maintaining consistent style and having good documentation and comments.
